Hi there 👋

I enjoy exploring a variety of topics in programming, from low-level systems to mobile development. I love getting a better understanding of how things work under the hood, and I enjoy writing code that is both efficient and well-designed.

While I'm not a professional developer, I'm always learning and building projects to deepen my understanding and create useful tools.

My Interests 🛠️
- Low-Level: Working C, Rust, Zig, and assembly to understand system fundamentals.
- Operating Systems: Exploring how systems like Linux function.
- Android/Multiplatform Development: Building Android and Multiplatform apps.
- Libraries & Tooling: I enjoy building reusable libraries to solve common problems, even in high-level languages.
- Reverse Engineering: I would love to learn about this but don't know where to start.
